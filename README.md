As a data engineer, I used my skills in ETL & aws services to create data pipline .
The purpose of this project is to move data from s3 bucket (source) to another s3 bucket (destenation) using AWS Glue.
Then, using crawler to convert data stored in s3 bucket (destination) into a table in database .
Finally, I used AWS ATHENA to apply query on database stored on crawler and connect database to quicksight to visualize data.
